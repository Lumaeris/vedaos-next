# VedaOS

> [!WARNING]
> To be discontinued. While it was a great learning project and my main atomic system for several months, I don't think I need to do all the work and try to "optimize" my experience. Most of the changes are already in Bazzite, which I suggest to try out instead of this particular one. Or maybe Ultramarine Bootc, whenever it happens to finally be released. Little to no changes will be made after adding this note, and it will be discontinued around the time when Fedora 44 comes to live.

> I mainly did this image due to growing frustation towards one particular former contributor of Bazzite, which thankfully was banned to ever contribute to Bazzite and Universal Blue permanently. I wouldn't go deep into this, but anyway from this alone (and eventual creation of Open Gaming Collective) I'm happy to daily-drive Bazzite once again. :P

Opinionated custom image with GNOME, preinstalled Steam and other goodies, based on [fedora-bootc](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/). Personal project with frequent changes.

Ready and fully functional for daily usage. Even though it's created for myself, you can use it if all you need is native Steam, Flatpak and Homebrew apps :slightly_smiling_face:

## What does it have?

- Starting from `quay.io/fedora/fedora-bootc` instead of [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue), that way we don't get any unwanted changes/packages from Silverblue.
- Uses [CachyOS' kernel](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos) (not Clang with Thin LTO because of NVIDIA bug of some sort).
- One of the first [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) images to switch to rpm-ostree's [`build-chunked-oci`](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/build-chunked-oci/) instead of relying on [hhd's rechunker](https://github.com/hhd-dev/rechunk) which had unnecessary fixes and file permission issues.
- Includes a service to fix `/etc/group` and `/etc/gshadow` desynchronization caused by hhd's rechunker, provided by Tulip (@tulilirockz)! ([`/usr/bin/rechunker-group-fix`](https://github.com/Lumaeris/vedaos/blob/main/files/system/usr/bin/rechunker-group-fix) and [related systemd service](https://github.com/Lumaeris/vedaos/blob/main/files/system/usr/lib/systemd/system/rechunker-group-fix.service)). It's also available on [Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium) now after being proven that it works.
- Same "batteries" you would expect from any [Universal Blue base image](https://github.com/ublue-os/main).
- Necessary packages for [GNOME](https://gnome.org). Took an inspiration from [Bluefin LTS](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin-lts).
- [Some extensions](#extensions) for GNOME!
- Applied [MoreWaita icon pack](https://github.com/somepaulo/MoreWaita) and [adw-gtk3 theme](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3) by default.
- [NVIDIA Open drivers](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules) are included out of the box (you can still use it on your AMD machine though). Supported GPUs are GTX 16xx and RTX series.
- NVIDIA Legacy drivers for older GPUs are available through LTS branch (`vedaos:lts`).
- Natively available [Steam](https://steampowered.com). Do I need to say much?
- [Gamescope](https://github.com/bazzite-org/gamescope) is here if needed.
- [extest](https://github.com/bazzite-org/extest) library is included as well so Steam won't freak out of seeing any controller.
- `rpm-ostree` is available for layering packages! ***But*** it's not adviced to do so, unless it's [Mullvad VPN](http://mullvad.net/) or something similar.
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is available as well! [Universal Blue's tap](https://github.com/ublue-os/homebrew-tap) does work here (I'm using their VSCodium package just fine)!
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) since why not.
- [Winetricks](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks). Still useful. `¯\_(ᵕ—ᴗ—)_/¯`
- [foundry](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/foundry). kolunmi suggested it to me as an alternative for GNOME Builder. It requires [flatpak-builder](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder) to be installed, which it is now.
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) is here. Podman Compose was preincluded as well but it can be installed via brew instead.
- [distrobox](https://distrobox.it/)! A better alternative to toolbx.
- Using [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) as a toolkit to create these images! It really does a heavy-lifting so we don't have to manually fix something that broke just because.
- Oh, we also have an autoupdater - [uupd](https://github.com/ublue-os/uupd)!

### Extensions

## Installation

You can install it by using this Live ISO which also includes default Flatpaks (only used for troubleshooting and installation): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1objBGbDHZiYd7NCqvHwzz2f3iIWdK5s3/view?usp=sharing (sha256: `ca069b92a23789e6ac97e9f38b40659a2df76778d43d9ad150a228068dc80231`) or download it from GitHub action artifacts: https://github.com/Lumaeris/vedaos/actions/runs/20879799080. (I'm not gonna setup R2 storage just for this lol)

Alternatively, if you have to, here's a command to manually rebase to it from any other Fedora Atomic image (like Bluefin) (don't forget to add `--enforce-container-sigpolicy` after doing so and rebooting so you'll be on signed image):

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/lumaeris/vedaos:latest
```

## Interesting images

Here's a lil list of images that were done by my friendos! :D

- [Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium) - THE Niri bootc image. It already does have some users! I've PR'd NVIDIA support btw.
- [XeniaOS](https://github.com/XeniaMeraki/XeniaOS) - Also a Niri bootc image, but this time using [Arch bootc](https://github.com/bootcrew/arch-bootc) image. Highly experimental.
- [solarpowered](https://github.com/askpng/solarpowered) - Yet another personal image. We share some experiences with each other to resolve some issues and stuff.
- [MizukiOS](https://github.com/koitorin/MizukiOS) - Niri bootc! Another one!! So many of these!!! It uses Bazzite GNOME as a base.
- [Entire Bootcrew project](https://github.com/bootcrew)! Tulip really cooked hard here.

## Dependence on Universal Blue

This list only exists for informational purposes.

### Direct

- ~~hhd's rechunker~~ - not anymore! We use upstream's `build-chunked-oci` as mentioned above.
- Legacy package marked as "batteries" - oversteer-udev.
- [Bluefin's Common OCI](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common) - used for getting LUKS stuff, udev rules and some internal stuff.
- brew - https://github.com/ublue-os/brew
- uupd - even though it was designed for ublue systems, it can still be used on any atomic system.
- Steam Deck backgrounds repackaged by Bazzite.
- Bazzite's fork of Gamescope.
- Bazzite's fork of libextest (not really any different from upstream).
- [Titanoboa](https://github.com/ublue-os/titanoboa) for Live ISO. Would be used very rarely though.

### In-direct

- Package lists taken from ublue base image and Bluefin LTS.
- Some specific useful fixes from them.
- The reason I started using Fedora Atomic in a first place :P.
- BlueBuild was influenced by ublue, now it's independent from them.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/lumaeris/vedaos
```
